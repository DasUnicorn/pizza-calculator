# "Work from Home" - Story Telling Game
"Work from home" is an interactive storytelling game where players take on the role of the protagonist in a dynamic narrative. The game can be played in the console or in a virtual console in the web-browser.
The game is centered around your first remote office day, where every choice you make influences the storyline and leads to different outcomes. Try to find as many endings as possible.

## Design

### Story and Inspiration
In creating the game, my aim was to craft a narrative that starts with a familiar scenario, gradually evolving into an increasingly intricate fantasy realm that rapidly intensifies in complexity and imagination.
I took inspiration from [Choose Your Own Adventure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choose_Your_Own_Adventure) Books where the palyer is *"making choices that determine the main character's actions and the plot's outcome"*, as well as the indie game ["Papers, Please"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papers,_Please). *"The game has a scripted story mode with twenty possible endings depending on the player's actions"* 

### Flowchart
One of the most challenging aspects was maintaining a clear overview of the story and its various plotlines. so it was necessary to create an extensive flowchart to document the progression. Each element within these flowcharts is designated with a star, serving as a marker to indicate the implementation level of the corresponding code (for example objects marked with the star and the number 8 are implemented in the function "level8(player)").
The preview of the board can be seen below. The [full Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVNHT1bqI=/?share_link_id=87020844922) can be inspected online.

![Miro Board](/assets/img/readme/miro.png)

### Gameplay
The game operates in the following manner: Users engage by making decisions, and in the background, a player object of the player class undergoes updates based on these choices. The player's character can experience growth or decline in stats, contingent on the decisions made. Additionally, the narrative takes divergent paths according to these choices. To achieve particular endings or storylines, players must have specific stats. Each player possesses an inventory where they can collect items, adding an extra layer of depth to the game.

![Player Class](/assets/img/readme/player.png)

The player stats are never shown directly to the player and instead written into the story.
While playing the player has to guess if they are strong or otherwise capable enough to undergo different options and the text gives them hints through their journey like "You feel stronger now", or "You are lucky and found ..." to have a sense about their own strengths.
This way it isn't obvious what choices are best to make and leaves the player to watch out for story clues.

### questionary
To make user interaction more user friendly and minimize input errors, the ["questionary"](https://questionary.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) library was integrated into the game.
This allows users to navigate through options using arrow keys and select their choice with the Enter key.
The use of "questionary" serves as a robust error prevention mechanism, ensuring smooth and intuitive decision-making throughout the gameplay.
User who haven't used a console before might as well be more familiar with this option, since it's not necessary to enter a lot of text or choose numbers from different options.

### story telling experience
To elevate the user experience, the text is deliberately revealed gradually on the screen, simulating the sensation of being written in real-time. This creates an intresting effect, akin to unfolding the pages of an actual story. This is allowing users to engage more deeply with the narrative as if reading a captivating tale, one sentence at a time. This approach aims to enhance the overall storytelling ambiance for a better user experience.

## Features

### Existing Features

#### start screen
The game commences with a start screen, featuring ASCII art, the title, and a count of the discovered endings. This screen serves as an introduction, providing a brief overview of the game's premise. Users are presented with options to initiate the game, reset their progress, or exit the application.

![start screen](/assets/img/readme/ascii-art.png)

![start screen](/assets/img/readme/start.png)

#### Deleting the current score
To reset all endings the user can delete the current scores by choosing this option from the main menu.
Feedback about the progress is shown to the user and confirmation is needed before deleting.

![delete option](/assets/img/readme/delete-yes.png)

![delete](/assets/img/readme/delete-no.png)

#### End the Game
To end the game savely this option is offered in the start screen as well as after finishing the run.

#### Entering a name
Upon initiation, the game prompts the user to provide their name and validates the input received. Following this, the user is greeted by name, establishing a personalized connection. While the name isn't presently integrated into the gameplay, it is intended to utilize the player's name in conjunction with the discovered endings to formulate a leaderboard.

![name](/assets/img/readme/name.png)

#### Story, Chosing an answer
At the core of the game lies the text-based storytelling. The interactive nature of the game unfolds through the selection of options that shape the story's progression. The user is prompted for feedback, and a set of options is presented, inviting the player to actively participate and make decisions that influence the direction of the narrative. This dynamic interaction not only engages the player in the unfolding tale but also empowers them to be a key architect of the story and explore different options.
The whole story is written by myself.

![game](/assets/img/readme/game.png)

#### Finding an ending
When an ending is found the user is presented with "the end" in ascii art as well as the number and name of the ending.

![end](/assets/img/readme/end.png)

#### SpreadSheet
The google sheet works as a database, designed to store the endings found by the user.
Each ending gets written into the google sheet when found and reset to the default value when deleted.

![Google Sheet](/assets/img/readme/sheet.png)

### Possible Future Features

#### Accessibility
* It would be great to support text-to-speech functionality, so that players with visual impairments can enjoy the game.
* It would be cool to customizable text size and contrast options, so that players with different visual preferences can comfortably play the game.

#### Easier Replay
* As a player that returns to the story multiple time, the slow text can be annoying. I would love to have a fast-forward option for previously read text, so that the player can explore alternative paths without re-reading entire sections, or getting them faster.
* To find specific endings it would be great to save mid decision, so the player can explore paths later. 

#### Multiple Accounts
* Currently the game is build with one sheet that saves all the progress for everyone playing this game. It would be great to implement a login, so each player has there own save.
* The inclusion of a highscore board adds a competitive and goal-oriented dimension to the gaming experience. Players can compare their achievements, such as the number of endings discovered or other relevant metrics, fostering a sense of accomplishment and encouraging replayability.

#### Level Design
To test the level design, each potential ending undergoes a examination to ensure it can be reached through the intended pathway. This involves manual testing, where every conceivable route leading to an ending is carefully evaluated and documented in the corresponding test files. The path is represented by the sequence of options chosen during gameplay, with each number denoting the position of the respective answers. For instance, "4 - 2 - 1" signifies selecting the 4th option, followed by the 2nd, and finally the 1st option in the given context. This protocol ensures a comprehensive validation of the game's various storylines and endings.
Due to the size of the file, the results can be found in a seperate file called "level-testen", which is saved in [CSV](/assets/tests/level-tests.csv) and [PDF](/assets/tests/level-tests.pdf) Version.

### Unfixed Bugs

#### User iput while slow text
While the text is slowly printed on the screen, every input made by the user is displayed in the text.
One potential solution is to temporarily disable keyboard input during the slow printing process. By implementing this approach, you ensure that user inputs are not inadvertently displayed in the text until the printing is complete. 

![bug-text](/assets/img/readme/bug-text.png)

### Fixed Bugs



##### "Inventory takes 1 argument, but 2 were given"
![bug inventory](/assets/img/readme/bug-inventory.png)
After implementing the is_in_inventory it looked like this:

```
    # --- Check inventory --- #
    def is_in_inventory(obj):
        """
        Returns true if given object is in the players inventory.
        Returns false if given objects is NOT in the players inventory.
        """
        if obj in self.inventory:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```
Taking only on argument, the obj to check for, into account.
But since multiple instances of a player object can be build, the code needs to be given a self to check.

Solution:

```
    # --- Check inventory --- #
    def is_in_inventory(self, obj):
        """
        Returns true if given object is in the players inventory.
        Returns false if given objects is NOT in the players inventory.
        """
        if obj in self.inventory:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```


##### "level12() missing 1 requirement positional argument: 'player'""

![bug player missing](/assets/img/readme/bug-player-missing.png)

To transfer the current player object that contains the stats of the player from level to level it need to be handed down from function to function.

Here I have missed to call the function level12() with the player object:

```
level12()
```

By giving it the current player, it can get and update stats inside the player object.

```
level12(player)
```
