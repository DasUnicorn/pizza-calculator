# "Work from Home" - Story Telling Game
"Work from home" is an interactive storytelling game where players take on the role of the protagonist in a dynamic narrative. The game can be played in the console or in a virtual console in the web-browser.
The game is centered around your first remote office day, where every choice you make influences the storyline and leads to different outcomes. Try to find as many endings as possible.

## User Experience

### Target Audience
The taget audience are people who enjoy interactive storytelling and decision-based games.
Due to the content of the story I advice a minumum age of 14 years to play along.
This game can be played as a casual gamer, who prefer games that can be played in shorter sessions and do not require a significant time commitment, or excessively to find all possible endings.

### Possible Future Features

#### Accessibility
* It would be great to support text-to-speech functionality, so that players with visual impairments can enjoy the game.
* It would be cool to customizable text size and contrast options, so that players with different visual preferences can comfortably play the game.

#### Easier Replay
* As a player that returns to the story multiple time, the slow text can be annoying. I would love to have a fast-forward option for previously read text, so that the player can explore alternative paths without re-reading entire sections, or getting them faster.
* To find specific endings it would be great to save mid decision, so the player can explore paths later.
