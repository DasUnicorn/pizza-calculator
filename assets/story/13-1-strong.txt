The force of your punch proves unexpectedly potent, shattering the Terminator-like computer into a cascade of hardware pieces.
The room, once a battlefield, is now littered with the remnants of the mechanical pieces.
You find yourself standing amidst the scattered hardware, the outside is getting dark and the whole day is gone.
Your hand hurts, your power is gone and your body collapse in on itself.
You won.
