With each step, you traverse the virtual desktop â€” a sprawling expanse that
mirrors the organization of digital files, icons, and shortcuts.
The familiar symbols of software and applications surround you.
The mouse cursor starts moving and you follow it by jumping into a folder.
You find yourself walking into a file within the folder, and before you can
fully comprehend the situation, the document you are in gets printed.
In an instant, you emerge onto a piece of paper within your company's office
building.
The moment you left the digital word you emerge into your real for and pop out
from the paper in human fresh again.
Colleagues pass by, their expressions a mixture of confusion and surprise.
I guess you don't work from home anymore.
