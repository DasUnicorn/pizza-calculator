In a turn of events, your initial frustration with the problematic computer
evolves into a rather unconventional coping mechanism â€” You begin talking to
the machine as if it were a sentient being.
"Alright, my digital companion, let's figure this out together," you muse.
In the absence of tangible solutions, your interactions with the computer take
on a conversational nature, as if you were coaching a friend through a tough
time.
As you continue to address the computer, the tone of your conversations shifts
from exasperation to a more supportive and understanding vibe. "I know you're
doing your best," you say with a hint of empathy.
In this newfound friendship from now on the machine and you work in unity.
Have you turned crazy, or just into the Disney princess of technology?
Nobody knows.
