The pixel figures take you to their home pixel city, where everyone greets you with welcome and open arms.
They ask a lot of questions about your world and where you are coming from.

With a genuine smile, they extend an invitation, "Do you want to join us?"
The choice is once again presented before you â€” to test you strength or your charisma.
