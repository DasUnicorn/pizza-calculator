In the surreal world of Morse code negotiations, a peculiar deal takes shape. An agreement between human and machine that holds the promise of liberation from the shackles of work in exchange for a carte blanche on the vast expanse of the internet.
The rhythmic hum of the computer, now pulsating with a newfound purpose, seems to convey an air of satisfaction. The virtual handshake is struck, and the unspoken pact unfolds. As the computer delves into the realm of my professional tasks, a sense of liberation washes over me. The weight of deadlines and responsibilities lifts.
As the day concludes, I reflect on the whimsical turn of events. This must be the future.
