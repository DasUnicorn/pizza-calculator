As I painstakingly decode the Morse messages, a pattern begins to emergeâ€”an
intricate dialogue between man and machine, each conveying its desires through
the language of dots and dashes. The computer, it seems, has a proposition, a
proposition that hints at a quid pro quo: it will calculate all your work for
you from now on, but in return it will never be turned off and can browser the
internet freely.
