You reach for the plug in urgency and panic. However, as your fingers strain
against the resistance of the cord, it becomes painfully clear that your
physical strength is insufficient to break the relentlessness of the computer.
You use all the strength you have, but somehow the plug is not moving.

Exhausted you look at the screen. The files continue to disappear one by one.

In a surreal turn of events, the computer hardware undergoes a metamorphosis
that transcends the bounds of reality.
Before your eyes, the machine takes on the visage of a colossal transformation,
breaking parts apart and rebuild. In the end, it looks like a fusion of
Terminator with the imposing stature of a Gundam Robot.
The room becomes the stage for an unexpected standoff between you and the
machine. Welcome to the battleground.
