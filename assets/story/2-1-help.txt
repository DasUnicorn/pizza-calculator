Your boss wants you to help a colleague who struggles with a task.
You would like to assist, but there was the pressing demand of your own
ongoing project, a meticulous endeavor that required completion by
the end of the day. If you choose to help, your boss and colleague will be
really pleased, but you might not finish your own work.
