Despite your best efforts at troubleshooting and seeking technical solutions,
the digital nemesis remains unyielding, casting a shadow over the smooth flow
of my workday.
In desperation you start talking to the computer, while errors keep flashing
over the screen. The surreal nature of the situation becomes evident as you
catch yourself engaging in a one-sided conversation. The hum of the computer's
malfunctioning components serves as the backdrop to your monologue, 
or ... isn't it?
Are you going crazy, or does the blinking of the error messages look like
a pattern?
