You dial the emergency number, desperately seeking backup.
The operator's voice crackles through the line, and with a sense of urgency,
you attempt to convey the bizarre situation unfolding in your office â€” 
the floating computer, the fiery spectacle, the inexplicable transformation.
Your earnest plea for assistance is met with incredulous laughter on the other
end.
"You're saying a flying computer attacked you? That's a new one.
Don't waste our time with prank calls," the operator chuckles dismissively
before abruptly ending the call.
As you hang up the phone, a mix of frustration and resignation sets in.
The disbelief and laughter of the operator echo in your mind.
You are alone and on your own.
