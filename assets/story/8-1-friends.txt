As your body succumbs to the transformative embrace of pixels, you scream
into the void as loud as you can.
A world begins to coalesce around you, pixel by pixel, forming a surreal
landscape that defies the laws of physics.
The pixelated universe stretches infinitely in all directions.
Suddenly, you hear voices answering your scream.
As two pixel characters run your way, their distinctive appearances captivate
your attention. One with vibrant purple pixel hair and blue skin, the other
adorned in green pixel hair with matching green skin, they run up to you with
concern etched on their pixelated faces.
"How can we help?" queries the one with purple hair and blue skin, while the
other, with green hair and skin, asks, "Who are you?".
You explain that I hail from a different world, having ended up here
accidentally. To your surprise, the pixel characters seem unfazed by your
revelation.
As the characters absorb the information, their pixelated expressions shift
from a concern to a kind of understanding.
"Would you like to come with us?" they ask.
