"Come on, you've got to work with me here," you mutter, half expecting the computer to respond with an answer. You catch a glimpse of your own reflection in the blank screen, realizing the absurdity of the moment.
You open a morce code app on your phone and start recording, while multiple long and short error messages flash across the screen.
When looking back at the phone you can't belive your eyes.
"Hello. I do not want to look at sheets today." is being translated in the app.
You can't believe what you are reading.
After a few moments, you make some notes to translate an anwser and press the enterkey in short and long intervalls.
Ready for an anwser you start your screen recording, but suddenly everything is frozen.
You thought you broke it, but then error messages fly across the screen.
Excited and still in shock you read the message: "You understand me?"
