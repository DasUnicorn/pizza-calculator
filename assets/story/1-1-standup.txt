The familiar faces of your colleagues, each framed by the boundaries of
their respective home offices, smiled back at you through the screen.
Each of you were bound by a common goal: 
Getting the work of the day done.
The morning call had set the tone for your day,
infusing your home office with a sense of camaraderie.
