The routine of your pre-office workout had seamlessly transitioned into
a homebound ritual. You are not skipping this today.
The familiar scent of yoga mat material greeted you as you unrolled it onto 
the floor, transforming a small patch of the room into your personal spa.
Each intentional breath seemed to dissolve the remnants of morning fatigue,
leaving you feeling revitalized and ready to tackle the challenges that lay
ahead.
As the final stretch brought the workout to a close,
a sense of accomplishment lingered in the air.
You start the day feeling strong and powerfull.
Nothing can stop you now.
