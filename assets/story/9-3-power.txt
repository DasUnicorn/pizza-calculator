In a desperate attempt, you lunge for the power button.
With a swift press, the room plunges into sudden darkness.
For a moment there were no errors, no humming of the computer and no screen
light.
However, the silence is accompanied by an unexpected spectacle. As the computer
has powered down, sparks of iridescent flames erupt from its metallic frame,
casting an otherworldly glow across the room.
The computer starts to hoover, breaking free of its static form and frees
itself from all cables.
