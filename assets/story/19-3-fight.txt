As the last opponent is defeated, your pixelated avatar dissolves, and a tingling sensation courses through your fingers.
The vibrant pixelated world around you fades away.

With a mix of wonder and contemplation, you sit in front of the computer, reflecting on the strange journey that happened.
The journey may have ended, but the memories stay.
