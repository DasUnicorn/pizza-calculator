You reach into your pockets, searching for something â€” anything that might help you in this situation. To youself dismay, your pockets yield nothing. Panic sets in briefly until your eyes scan the surroundings.
You spot the stick you have taken home from your walk earlier.
You clasp it firmly in your hand.
You extend the stick towards the Terminator-like computer, navigating it towards the power button.
As the stick makes contact with the power button, the computer powers down and crumples to the floor. the once-angry adversary now reduced to a dormant machine.
The room, now silent and devoid of the earlier tension, becomes your office again.
Or what is left from it.
